# Dolt Git Integration - Current State Summary

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** üîß Infrastructure Complete, Data Export Broken  
**Next Priority:** Fix CSV export pipeline

---

## What We Accomplished ‚úÖ

### 1. Complete Command Infrastructure
- All `dolt git` commands implemented and registered
- `clone`, `push`, `pull`, `add`, `commit`, `status`, `log` working
- Enhanced authentication with SSH keys, tokens, diagnostics
- Progress reporting and error handling

### 2. Working Authentication & Connectivity
- SSH key authentication working with GitHub
- SSH agent integration and key loading
- Comprehensive diagnostics command
- Connection testing and troubleshooting guides

### 3. Repository Operations
- Git repository creation and management
- Metadata generation and README creation
- Directory structure and file organization
- Chunking framework for large datasets

### 4. Successful Small-Scale Testing
- Sample data (employees/departments) exports correctly
- Command workflow functions properly
- GitHub integration pushes and updates repository
- Infrastructure handles authentication and operations

---

## Critical Issues Discovered üö®

### 1. Empty CSV Export (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Real data exports as empty CSV files
- Metadata shows correct row counts and schema
- But actual CSV files contain no data
- Repository structure created correctly, content missing

### 2. History Loss (CRITICAL)  
**Problem:** Dolt commit history completely ignored
- Only single "export" commit created in Git
- Rich Dolt history with branches, merges lost
- Defeats core purpose of version-controlled data sharing

### 3. Scale Testing Failure
**Problem:** Large dataset testing revealed the above issues
- holywritings/bahaiwritings dataset (39K+ chunks) downloaded
- Export process failed with empty files
- Infrastructure handled scale, but data export failed

---

## Current Repository State

### GitHub: lapingvino/holywritings-dolt
- ‚úÖ Repository exists and accessible
- ‚úÖ Contains proper structure (data/, .dolt-metadata/, README.md)  
- ‚ùå CSV files are empty (critical issue)
- ‚ùå No commit history (single snapshot only)

### Local Development
- ‚úÖ Dolt binary built and working
- ‚úÖ Git integration commands available
- ‚úÖ Authentication configured (SSH keys loaded)
- ‚úÖ Test scripts and diagnostics ready

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Debug CSV Export
```bash
# Create minimal test case
dolt init
dolt sql -q "CREATE TABLE test (id INT, name VARCHAR(50));"
dolt sql -q "INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');"
dolt git add test
dolt git commit -m "Test data"
dolt git push --dry-run

# Debug: Check if CSV contains actual data
# Location: go/libraries/doltcore/git/chunking.go
```

### Priority 2: Add Data Validation
- Verify CSV files contain expected data after export  
- Add logging throughout export pipeline
- Compare exported data with source tables

### Priority 3: Fix History Preservation
- Map Dolt commits to Git commits
- Preserve commit messages, authors, timestamps
- Handle branching and merging scenarios

---

## Files to Focus On

### Core Export Logic
- `go/libraries/doltcore/git/chunking.go` - CSV generation
- `go/cmd/dolt/commands/gitcmds/push.go` - Export pipeline
- Table reading and streaming interfaces

### Working References
- Bundle export/import (similar functionality)
- Existing CSV commands in Dolt
- Small data test case (employees/departments worked)

---

## Test Data Available

### Working Test Data
- Small synthetic tables (employees, departments) 
- Successfully exports and round-trips
- Good for debugging basic functionality

### Failed Test Data  
- holywritings/bahaiwritings dataset downloaded locally
- Large scale, real-world religious texts
- Perfect for testing fixes once export works

---

## Success Criteria

When fixed, the system should:

1. **Export real data** - CSV files contain actual table contents
2. **Preserve history** - All Dolt commits visible as Git commits  
3. **Handle scale** - Large datasets export with proper chunking
4. **Round-trip perfectly** - Export ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Identical data
5. **Enable collaboration** - Teams can use Git workflows on data

---

## Resources & Context

### Documentation Created
- `GIT_INTEGRATION_TODO.md` - Detailed bug analysis and fixes needed
- `GIT_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete architecture overview  
- `GIT_INTEGRATION_STATUS_UPDATE.md` - Current status and issues
- Test scripts: `quick_git_test.sh`, `deploy_holywritings.sh`

### Key Insights
- Infrastructure is solid and well-designed
- Authentication and operations work correctly
- The core data export pipeline has fundamental issues
- History mapping was never implemented
- Small test data masks the real problems

**Bottom Line:** We have a solid foundation with critical data export bugs that need immediate attention before this can be production-ready.
