## Critical Success Indicators

### 🎯 Primary Success Metrics

1. **NO Placeholder Data Found**
   - ❌ Should NOT see: `dolt_row_0_col_0, dolt_row_0_col_1, dolt_row_0_col_2`
   - ✅ Should see: `1,Prayer for Assistance,O God! O God! Thou art...`

2. **Real Content Verification**
   - ✅ Religious text content in `writings.csv`
   - ✅ Employee names in `employees.csv`
   - ✅ Language codes in `languages.csv`
   - ✅ Proper data types (numbers, strings, text)

3. **File Size Validation**
   - ✅ `writings.csv` should be 2MB+ (contains full religious texts)
   - ✅ Other CSV files should have reasonable sizes (not empty)
   - ✅ Total repository size should be substantial

### 🚫 Failure Indicators

**If ANY of these appear, the bug fix FAILED:**

1. **Placeholder Data Found:**
   ```csv
   id,title,content
   dolt_row_0_col_0,dolt_row_0_col_1,dolt_row_0_col_2
   dolt_row_1_col_0,dolt_row_1_col_1,dolt_row_1_col_2
   ```

2. **Empty or Tiny Files:**
   - CSV files under 100 bytes
   - Only header lines, no data rows

3. **Export Errors:**
   - "failed to read row" errors
   - "prolly tree" related failures
   - Authentication/push failures

## Expected Final Report

### 🎉 Success Summary
```
================================
TEST COMPLETED
================================
🎉 Holywritings dataset export test SUCCESSFUL! 🎉

```

### 📊 Impact Assessment

**BEFORE (Broken):**
- CSV files contained useless placeholder data
- GitHub repository was professionally formatted but completely unusable
- No real data collaboration possible

**AFTER (Fixed):**
- CSV files contain actual religious texts, names, and data
- GitHub repository is immediately useful for research and collaboration
- Full Git workflows enabled for data teams

## Repository Contents After Success

The GitHub repository should contain:

```
holywritings-dolt/
├── data/
│   ├── writings/
│   │   └── writings.csv (2MB+, religious texts)
│   ├── employees/
│   │   └── employees.csv (contributor data)
│   ├── departments/
│   │   └── departments.csv (organizational data)
│   └── languages/

├── .dolt-metadata/
│   ├── manifest.json (repository metadata)
│   ├── schema.sql (table schemas)
│   └── tables/ (individual table metadata)
└── README.md (auto-generated documentation)
```

**Key Validation Points:**
- ✅ All CSV files contain real, human-readable data
- ✅ Religious texts are properly formatted and complete
- ✅ Data types are preserved (strings, numbers, dates)
- ✅ Repository structure is professional and documented
- ✅ Total size reflects actual data content (not empty files)
